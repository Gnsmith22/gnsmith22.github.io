# Looking Forward

I am excited for the future to put my new digital skills to use and to be able to starting looking at the digital humanities world through a new, more knowledgeable able lens. The first thing I am going to do after this class is further develop my embroidery skills. After completing the embroidery workshop, I not have a much stronger interest in this skill. I plan on going a step forward and embroidering something that takes more skill that what I did during the workshop. I hope that I can become better at embroidering and start embroidering some items that I own to personalize them. I also plan on reading the book titled, _Blood in the Machine_ by Brian Merchant. I am a big reader and this book seems extremely interesting. I would love to know more about how machines have taken over different jobs especially because technology is only going to continue to grow in our lifetime. Lastly, I am going to learn a new type of code. Since I am already familiar with markdown and HTML, I think I can move on to something more difficult. To do this I am going to learn Python because I have learned that it is one of the easiest programming languages, therefore I believe it is a good place to start. To do this, I am going to use the website Codeacademy to learn for free. I look foward to continuing my knowledhe on digital humanities with these three future steps.
