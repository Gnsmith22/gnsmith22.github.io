My name is Gracie Smith, I am a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences studying Politics, Philosophy, and Economics. I enjoy playing lacrosse, reading, and doing active things such as yoga, long walks, and swimming. This class is a first look for me into the digital humanities world. While certain aspects of it have been challenging for me, I have enjoyed learning all about the field and navigating through these difficulties. I hope you enjoy my portfolio which should give a glipse into all that I have learned throughout the semester.
